* Backend Design
** Hash Table 1 
=Key=:   Name
=Value=: Pointer to [[Item structure]].

** Hash Table 2
=Key=:   Shelf 
=Value=: List of all items stored there.

** Misc

<<Item Structure>>
  - Name
  - Description
  - Price
  - Amount
  - List of [[Shelf Structure]]s and amount in each shelf

<<Shelf Structure>>
  - Shelf Name
  - Quantity


** Requirements

1. Given the name of an item, 
   find its information

2. Given the name of an item, 
   find its storage locations in the warehouse

3. Given a storage location, 
   find what is stored on it

We can design a struct *S* that holds the information about an item
*i* as well as a list *L* of the locations in the warehouse storing
*i*’s, including the number of items at each location.


- Item i   (Item)
- Struct S (Information regarding i)
- List L   (Locations of i)

We can then use our hash table from Assignment 1 using 

*** HT1 
 Hash Table with  [ ~HTn→S~ ]
  - names of items as keys
  - pointers to instances of S as values.

 =HTn→S=: a central hash table mapping names1 of 
 items to their information.

*** HT2
 Hash Table with [ ~HTs→n~ ]
  - storage location names as keys
  - items (or item names) as values. 

 =HTs→n= a central hash table mapping names of storage 
 locations to names of items stored on the location
 for each item S, a list L of the locations where it is
 stored, and the amount stored at each location

 _Need to keep HTn→S and HTs→n in sync_
